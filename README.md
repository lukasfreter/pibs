# Permutational Invariance Block Solver

Code for calculating the dynamics of the dissipative Tavis-Cummings model with local incoherent processes (no gain!). An example is given in example.py.

In the file setup.py, the supercompressed block form of the Liouvillian and the density matrix is calculated. 

propagate.py contains the functionality of serial and parallel time evolution.
